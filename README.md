## Build and Run Instructions

### Prerequisites
- .NET 9 SDK installed
- Visual Studio 2022 or VS Code with C# extension

### Building the Solution

```bash
# Navigate to the solution root directory
cd TaskTracker

# Restore NuGet packages
dotnet restore

# Build the solution
dotnet build

# Run tests
dotnet test
```

### Running the Application

```bash
# Navigate to the console app project
cd src/TaskTracker.ConsoleApp

# Run the application
dotnet run
```

### Using the Application

Once running, you can use these commands:
- `add <title>` - Create a new todo item
- `list` - Show all todo items
- `done <id>` - Mark a todo as complete
- `delete <id>` - Remove a todo item
- `exit` - Quit the application

### Database Files

The application creates two SQLite database files:
1. `task_tracker.db` - Contains todo items and telemetry data (logs, spans)
2. The database is automatically created on first run

### Key Features Implemented

1. **Clean Architecture**: Proper separation of concerns with Domain, Application, Infrastructure, and Presentation layers
2. **Dependency Injection**: Full DI container setup using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection
3. **Entity Framework Core**: SQLite database with code-first approach
4. **OpenTelemetry**: Complete observability with:
   - Distributed tracing (Activities/Spans)
   - Structured logging
   - Custom SQLite exporters to persist telemetry
5. **Async/Await**: All I/O operations are asynchronous
6. **Unit Testing**: Comprehensive tests using xUnit and in-memory database
7. **Modern C# 13**: File-scoped namespaces, top-level statements, nullable reference types
8. **Error Handling**: Graceful exception handling throughout

This solution demonstrates production-quality patterns and practices for a .NET 9 console application with full observability and testing.
